# Rural Health Transformation State Guides

This repository packages state-specific guides that summarize how the Rural Health Transformation Collaborative can support applications to the CMS Rural Health Transformation Program. Each guide is distributed as a PDF in the root directory so stakeholders can review or share them without additional tooling.

## How the Guides were Produced by AI
- **Shared source package:** CMS RHT grant solicitation and the Rural Health Transformation Collaborative overview documents were provided to GPT-5 AI as the core reference set.
- **State-level research:** GPT-5 supplemented those documents with web search to discover public, state-specific data—regulatory updates, health indicators, broadband stats, and Medicaid policy notes—to ensure every section is grounded in current facts and citations.
- **Structured drafting:** Using a consistent outline, GPT-5 assembled a narrative that maps Collaborative capabilities to the grant requirements, highlights dependencies, and flags assumptions that need validation.

## Guide Contents
Every guide follows the same compliance-oriented structure:
- Executive context that links CMS scoring needs with state-specific signals
- Tables that map Rural Health Transformation requirements to collaborative capabilities
- Option comparisons, dependency tracking, risk registers, and validation checklists
- A closing AI generation notice that discloses the model used and reminds readers to validate all data

## Intended Use
These PDFs are designed for state health agencies, Medicaid leaders, rural providers, and collaborative partners preparing CMS RHT applications. They serve as advisory briefs—teams should confirm all figures, statutes, and assumptions against authoritative sources before submission.
