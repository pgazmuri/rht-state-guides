# Rural Health Transformation State Guides

This repository packages state-specific guides that summarize how the Rural Health Transformation Collaborative can support applications to the CMS Rural Health Transformation Program. Each guide is distributed as a PDF in the root directory so stakeholders can review or share them without additional tooling.

## How the Guides were Produced by AI
- **Shared source package:** CMS RHT grant solicitation and the Rural Health Transformation Collaborative overview documents were provided to GPT-5 AI as the core reference set.
- **State-level research:** GPT-5 supplemented those documents with web search to discover public, state-specific data—regulatory updates, health indicators, broadband stats, and Medicaid policy notes—to ensure every section is grounded in current facts and citations.
- **Structured drafting:** Using a consistent outline, GPT-5 assembled a narrative that maps Collaborative capabilities to the grant requirements, highlights dependencies, and flags assumptions that need validation.

## AI-Generated Content Warning

!!! AI-GENERATED CONTENT WARNING !!!

All guides and response examples in this repository are AI-generated drafts created with the GPT-5 family of models.
They contain factual errors, outdated references, and placeholder language.
Every data point, citation, and recommendation must be independently validated against primary sources (CMS NOFO, state statutes, official datasets, etc.) before use in any official communication or submission.

By using these materials you acknowledge that you are responsible for performing full diligence and ensuring compliance with all applicable policies.


## Guide Contents
Every guide follows the same compliance-oriented structure:
- Executive context that links CMS scoring needs with state-specific signals
- Tables that map Rural Health Transformation requirements to collaborative capabilities
- Option comparisons, dependency tracking, risk registers, and validation checklists
- A closing AI generation notice that discloses the model used and reminds readers to validate all data

## Response Examples
The `response_examples/` directory contains a handful of full-length mock response packets in PDF format. Each file simulates what a complete submission could look like once experts finish validation.
Generating these examples requires a deeper GPT-5-Pro research cycle (multiple targeted runs, document synthesis, and review), so only a subset of states is currently available.
If you need a state that is not listed yet, let me know—I'm happy to generate additional samples on request and add them to this folder as they are completed.
All sample responses mirror the AI content warning above and must be treated purely as planning artifacts until every citation and recommendation is independently confirmed.

## Intended Use
These PDFs are designed for state health agencies, Medicaid leaders, rural providers, and collaborative partners preparing CMS RHT applications. They serve as advisory briefs—teams should confirm all figures, statutes, and assumptions against authoritative sources before submission.
